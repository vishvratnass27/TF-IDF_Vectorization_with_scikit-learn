This repository contains Python code that demonstrates TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization using scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer`. TF-IDF is a common technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis and feature extraction.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python and scikit-learn installed on your machine. You can install scikit-learn using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

Once you have the required dependencies, you can clone this repository or download the code to your local machine.

## Usage

The main code file, `tfidf_vectorization.py`, demonstrates how to use scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer` to convert a collection of text documents into TF-IDF feature vectors.

## Functions and Methods

Here are some of the key functions and methods used in the code:

- `TfidfVectorizer()`: Initializes the TF-IDF vectorizer with various options.
- `fit(corpus)`: Learns the vocabulary and IDF from the training data.
- `transform(corpus)`: Transforms text documents into TF-IDF matrices.
- `get_feature_names_out()`: Retrieves feature (word) names.
- `get_params()`: Gets the parameters of the vectorizer.
- `get_stop_words()`: Gets the effective stop words list.
- `inverse_transform(tfidf_matrix)`: Returns terms per document.
- `build_analyzer()`: Builds a callable to process input data.
- `build_preprocessor()`: Builds a function for text preprocessing.
- `decode(encoded_text)`: Decodes TF-IDF encoded text.

## Examples

The code includes examples of using the `TfidfVectorizer` to preprocess and transform text data. For instance:

- Learning vocabulary and transforming text documents into TF-IDF matrices.
- Tokenization of text using the `build_analyzer()` function.
- Preprocessing text using the `build_preprocessor()` function.
- Decoding TF-IDF encoded text.
